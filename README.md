W.O.O.F.!

W.O.O.F. stands for "We Out of Food!" This is an app designed to locate dog-friendly restaurants according to cuisine type and distance to parks and recreational locations. By utilizing Yelp API, park locations are specified according to address, and the user can also dictate the type of food they (and their dogs) want to eat. Once the location is entered, restaurants that both fit the food designations and are in close proximity to the park are listed.

Directions to the restaurant from the park (and vice versa) are also appended via a Mapquest API call, allowing travel for users and their furry little buds.

The creators of W.O.O.F. are also dog enthusiasts and are constantly looking to share their love and knowledge of dogs to the world. The landing page also sports an array of fun and interesting facts of (wo)man's best friend, all of which are powered with a Dog Fact API.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML, CSS
- Javascript and JQuery
- Bootstrap CSS
- CORS-anywhere (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com)

- Yelp Fusion API, Mapquest API, and DOG API (via https://github.com/kinduff/dog-api)
